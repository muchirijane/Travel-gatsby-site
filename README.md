## About the site
This is a simple website build with Gatsby and styled-components to make it not only fast but also static compared to just using react only. 
Building the site helped to get to know to use images in Gatsby and how to use Graphql to render the data to the front end side. I truly learned a lot from the Official Gatsby documentation with clear stated examples.
